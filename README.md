***i dont plan to do any updates at all for this in the future. so please refrain from asking. but i do want to have fun with this & to hopefully learn something & put it to good use*** 😘👍

VJ application using shaders & uses OSC. this needs an OSC application for it to work. it did have a Lemur template, which is not in the repo. but it would be easy to remap to any other OSC application. there are not that many controls. 👍<br><br>
this was built & used for the band [thysen](https://thysen.bandcamp.com) over a series of dates on a mini tour.

## dependancies:

    ofxOsc
    ofxShader
    ofxGui - its in the project, but what i was trying didnt work. it doesnt break things, its just stuff that didnt work. only using the OSC controls on the end

enjoy, have phün & happy blisting your tits off on psychoactive visuals 😘
